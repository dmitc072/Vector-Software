The filter section, I am working on now, so it doesn’t work.
With using the “Arrange Shape”, you have to how select the “Select Tool” first. After that select the empty box below “first shape”, then select your shape. Do the same with second shape. Click on the pulldown “Choose your arrangement” to choose where you want to arrange your shape.

Using Stroke and Fill:
You can change it two ways:
1. By using the color wheel and selecting your color, then click “change stroke color” or “change fill color” 
2. By using the resize dialog box and entering the color (make sure you select the shape first), and click create change.

Changing the name of your shape:
You can change the name of your shape by click on the name in the “History” dialog box. Once you click, a dialog box will show so you can change the name.

Changing Dimension/Shape:
You can change shapes to ways:
1. Using the white selector button in the toolbar
2. Select the shape using the selector tool and input you number to change in the “Resize” dialog box, and click create button.
